Applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision. Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. Privacy and security are critical when deploying AI in real-world scenarios to protect sensitive data. Recent advances in GPUs have accelerated deep learning models, making AI more accessible and powerful."
