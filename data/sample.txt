Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. Applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition, and machine vision.

Machine learning is a subset of AI that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

Privacy and security are critical when deploying AI in real-world scenarios to protect sensitive data.

Recent advances in GPUs have accelerated deep learning models, making AI more accessible and powerful.
